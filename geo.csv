30.2049088,-97.6671315,Austin-Bergstrom International Airport,Start,"At the time of this trip, there was a big rental car shortage (and shortage of cars in general). The lot was almost completely empty - they were cleaning cars that had just been turned in and handing them over to people who were in line with reservations as fast as possible. Luckily we only had to wait about 20 minutes for a Nissan compact SUV.",1
30.2192082,-97.75524109999999,Walmart Supercenter,Supplies,"We got a styrofoam cooler and some supplies for sandwiches at Walmart so we could have food for a quick meal no matter where we were throughout the trip. We also picked up basic things like sunscreen, a first aid kit, and lots of water to keep in the car.",2
30.282339,-97.7429033,The Otis Hotel,Hotel,The Otis Hotel in Austin shares a building the the AC Marriot. It has record players in the rooms and you can check out vinyls in the lobby - we checked out Polo & Pan - Caravelle which happened to be on our road trip playlist. It has a nice rooftop bar that we hung out at for a little bit before calling it an early night due to the time change.,3
30.2833507,-97.7415642,Target,Groceries,We walked to the Target up the street to get coffee and a couple more things to keep in the cooler for the road.,4
30.2706904,-97.75237609999999,QI Austin: Modern Asian Kitchen,Dinner,We went to Qi based on a recommendation but we didn't have a reservation so we sat at the dim sum bar which turned out to be perfect. It wasn't cheap but it was a really good dinner and it would be fun to go back with a bigger group of people.,5
30.26975839999999,-97.7481007,OneTaco Taquería @ Little Woodrows (Food Trailer),Breakfast,We wanted to try some breakfast tacos in Austin so we looked up a place on our way out and ended up stopping here. They were super good and cheap - we should have bought extra for the road.,6
30.235495,-98.6666336,Gold Orchards Inc,Stop,This area has a ton of peach farms so we stopped by one and bought a little basket of ripe yellow peaches (probably too ripe for a road trip in hindsight).,7
30.2752011,-98.8719843,Wedding Oak Winery,Winery,We were surprised by the number of wineries in the area and ended up stopping at Wedding Oak Winery since the name was appropriate for the occasion. They had a couple of cool wines that were soaked in hops. We shared a quick tasting and had sandwiches in the car before heading out. Fredericksburg's main street has a lot going on but we decided to keep heading towards Terlingua.,8
30.1212487,-98.73231439999999,Shell,Stop,The guy who sold us the peaches told us there was a restroom in the Shell a few miles down the road so we took his advice and stopped there (he told us not to buy gas there so we didn't).,9
30.70637919999999,-101.1992355,Stripes Convenience Store,Gas,Ozona was one of our planned stops for gas.,10
30.7065678,-101.202931,Sonic Drive-in,Stop,This summer was breaking records for high temperatures - we stopped at the Sonic down the road to get a snack and some water.,11
30.3587474,-103.6620274,"Reata Restaurant-Alpine, TX",Dinner,"Alpine was one of our planned stops in between Austin and Terlingua, we looked up a place for an early dinner and ended up going to Reata which was pretty good and cheap.",12
30.3579647,-103.6610776,Greetings from Alpine Texas - Mural,Sight,There was a cool mural we found as we were walking to dinner and we stopped there on our way back to the car.,13
29.322339,-103.6154129,La Posada Milagro Guesthouse,Hotel,"The drive to Terlingua has a ton of ranches on the way. Our hotel was a cluster of casitas in the Terlingua ""Ghost Town"" which didn't seem that ghostly to me. It has a shared outdoor kitchen with an awesome view and we met some nice people who spend a lot of time at Big Bend National Park there.",14
29.31983,-103.6118215,Starlight Theatre Restaurant,Drinks,We walked down to the Starlight Theatre for a drink while we waited for the sun to set so we could go stargazing. It was pretty quiet but has a nice stage and I imagine it's awesome when there is live music. Someone told us they have festivals in the area and it gets packed then but it was nice and quiet while we were there.,15
29.327821,-103.2059287,Panther Junction Visitor Center,Visitor Center,The Panther Junction Visitor Center is on the way to the first trail we were heading towards and we had to stop there to get a park pass (because I forgot it). While we were waiting for the center to open we met a park volunteer who does illustrations for park materials (he was working on something for Junior Rangers at the time).,16
29.2704029,-103.300428,Chisos Basin Visitor Center,Visitor Center,"Once we got a new park pass, we drove to Chisos Basin and hiked part of the Window View trail from there.",17
29.165653,-103.6142077,Santa Elena Canyon Trail,Trail,"When we got back from the Window View, we took the Ross Maxwell Scenic drive to Santa Elena Canyon and hiked part of the trail there. You can walk into the river (and into Mexico) but the trail is on the US side and it goes pretty far into the canyon. We hiked part of it and ate sandwiches for lunch at the highest point. It was 100+ degrees so we didn't spend too much time in the heat. You have to take the scenic drive back out of the park so we stopped at a couple of the outlooks on the way out.",18
30.359924,-103.655718,Stripes,Gas,We got gas in Alpine since it was pretty expensive at the station in Big Bend.,19
30.3069097,-104.0276416,Porter's,Groceries,We went to the local Porter's grocery store in Marfa to get food for dinner since our hotel had a full kitchen.,20
30.3126277,-104.0222549,THE LINCOLN MARFA,Hotel,"We made a southwestern salad and a homemade ""peach sangria"" with the peaches we got in Fredericksburg and some local wine we got from Porter's. There is a little courtyard on the property that we ate in. After dinner we went for a walk around the Presidio County Courthouse across the street.",21

30.6034499,-104.5185005,Prada Marfa,Stop,Marfa to Tucson was one of our longest driving days. We stopped at the Prada exhibit in Valentine on the way out of Marfa for some artsy pictures.,23
31.7872445,-106.5056169,Mom's Fresh Juice + Kitchen,Stop,El Paso was one of our somewhat planned stops along the way to Tucson. Lauren was in the mood for a smoothie so we looked up smoothie places and settled on this one. I got a matcha latte smoothie that was really interesting.,24
31.7744646,-106.5004784,Starbucks,Stop,We drove a mile down the road and got coffee at Starbucks before continuing on.,25
32.2629383,-107.0064263,Bowlin's Old West Trading Post,Gas,There are a bunch of heavily advertised trading posts/gas stations on highway 10 between El Paso and Tucson. We decided to stop at one for fun and I ended up buying gas even though it was overpriced.,26
32.3301878,-109.5026689,Dwaynes Fresh Jerky,Stop,"We stopped at a jerky outlet and bought some tequila flavored pistachios and a two different styles of jerky. I love the Arizona/New Mexico style of jerky that is thin and dry, but they also had more of a tender, thicker style for Lauren. We were surprised by all of the nut farms you see along the highway - they just appear as random rows of trees in the middle of the desert.",27
32.2503701,-109.8304374,Willcox Commercial Co,Stop,"Just as we were surprised by Texas wine country, we were also surprised by Arizona wine country and we made a stop in Wilcox. There is a food hall-like tasting room with multiple wineries from Arizona. We did a tasting and picked up a couple of bottles there.",28
32.2215629,-110.9673821,AC Hotel by Marriott Tucson Downtown,Hotel,Tucson ended up being one of our favorite places during the road trip - the city was really fun with lots to do and lots of good food.,29
32.2219642,-110.9721883,Street- Taco and Beer Co.,Dinner,"Street Taco and Beer Co popped up when I looked for Mexican food on Yelp so we walked down Congress Street and got tacos there. We loved it - it was quick, really good, the employees were really nice, and it was cool inside.",30
32.2222374,-110.9708283,Chic Boutique and Spa,Stop,Lauren bought a dress at a shop we stopped by that had cool art in it as well.,31
32.222039,-110.970024,Cobra Arcade Bar Tucson,Drinks,"We stopped by this arcade bar to see if they had air hockey (a favorite of ours), but they did not. We had a quick drink here and left.",32
32.222184,-110.9673208,Hub Ice Cream Parlor,Stop,We shared some ice cream before walking around some more - it was 110 degrees even in the evening.,33
32.2218876,-110.9693205,Ten55 Brewing Company,Drinks,"We stopped here for a quick drink after trying to go to a bar called Batch next door, which was completely packed.",34
32.222337,-110.9668233,Hotel Congress,Drinks,We ended the evening at Hotel Congress for drinks and dancing. The hotel is very cool - they had live dancing and food trucks outside.,35
32.266571,-111.1774872,Hugh Norris Trailhead,Trail,"We hiked part of the Hugh Norris Trail in Saguaro National Park, which was one of my favorite hikes in the whole trip. Lauren was worried about rattlesnakes and mountain lions, but thankfully we didn't run into any. It got to 100+ degrees by 10 AM - I would have liked to do more of the trail but it we weren't really prepared for a long hike at the hottest time of day.",36
32.2544187,-111.1973189,Red Hills Visitor Center,Visitor Center,We went to the visitor center to get Lauren's national park passport stamp and some cactus merch.,37
32.2198055,-110.9854884,Seis Kitchen,Breakfast,Another place that came up when I was looking for Mexican food the night before was Seis Kitchen. I got a fantastic breakfast burrito there and ate in the little courtyard with shops and a bakery before heading back to the hotel to check out and drive to Sedona.,38
32.2214491,-110.9793041,Circle K,Gas,We grabbed some Coke Zero and gas at the station right next to the highway before continuing on towards Sedona.,39
34.8675953,-111.7631114,"Hyatt Residence Club Sedona, Piñon Pointe",Hotel,We drove straight through Phoenix - the rest of the drive was really beautiful with lots of variety in the landscape. Sedona just kind of pops out of nowhere with the red rock.,40
34.867335,-111.7623237,The Art of Wine,Drinks,We walked around the little shopping area next to our hotel and did some wine tasting at The Art of Wine. We bought a couple more bottles of Arizona wine here.,41
34.8663285,-111.7746478,Mariposa Latin Inspired Grill,Dinner,"Our nice/expensive dinner of the trip was at Mariposa, which has amazing views even though it was a little dark by the time we were there.",42
34.8259029,-111.788323,Cathedral Rock Trailhead,Trail,"We got an early start to the Cathedral Rock trailhead and the parking lot was already full, we got lucky by waiting to see someone head back to the parking lot and ask them for their spot (thank you people in the Tesla)",43
34.8622653,-111.7796783,CVS,Stop,We stopped at the CVS near Mariposa to get some supplies - I hurt my knee during the scramble part of the Cathedral Rock hike so we got a brace there.,44
35.1840575,-111.6591788,Target,Stop,We restocked the cooler at Target in Flagstaff before the Grand Canyon segment of the trip.,45
35.228313,-111.5561282,Picture Canyon Trailhead,Stop,We drove along Route 66 and followed signs to make an unplanned stop at Picture Canyon but we didn't quite make it there - we must have made a wrong turn and ended up in a restricted road so we turned around and headed back into town.,46
35.1954234,-111.6486286,Tourist Home All Day Cafe,Lunch,We parked in the downtown area of Flagstaff and walked around a bit then looked up places to eat - we settled on Tourist Home for lunch. They had live music while we were there.,47
35.1912648,-111.6610187,Speedi Car Wash & Fuel,Gas,I had to drive past a couple of gas stations to find something below $4/gal in Flagstaff before heading out.,48
35.9696111,-112.1292357,Best Western Premier Grand Canyon Squire Inn,Hotel,"This hotel had more amenities than we were expecting: indoor and outdoor pools, a little arcade, and even a few bowling lanes. We played $5 in games of air hockey at the arcade and we did end up bowling here after hiking.",49
35.9743181,-112.1268604,Grand Canyon IMAX Theater,Stop,We were recommended the documentary they show about the Grand Canyon at the IMAX theater down the road in Tusayan for $10 - it's an interesting 30-45 min documentary but I'd only recommend it if you have some extra time to kill. It talks a little bit about the history of the canyon in a narrative style.,50
35.9755323,-112.1247838,Tusayan General Store,Stop,"The general store in town actually had surprisingly good prices on lots of items, I was expecting high prices being so close to the park. We didn't really need much since we stopped at Target in Flagstaff.",51
36.0330415,-111.8532142,Lipan Point,Stop,"We drove through Desert View Drive, stopping at almost every viewpoint along the way to Lipan Point - the Tusayan Ruins and watchtower were closed when we were there so we couldn't stop there. We had sandwiches for dinner at Lipan Point",52
36.060432,-112.1393307,Bright Angel Trailhead,Trail,"We were at the trailhead by 5:15 AM to hike Bright Angel and we were planning to make it to Indian Garden before turning around - we ended up making it there and back in about 7 hours with breaks. We parked in Lot D by the Backcountry Information Office and there was plenty of parking space when we got there in the morning, but it was pretty full by the time we got back. We were surprised by how many people were attempting the hike so late in the morning - we had already seen one person airlifted from one of the outposts for dehydration and heat exhaustion. This was my favorite hike of the trip by far - not too tough from a hiking perspective but long and hot. There is a reason for all the signs that tell you not to hike to the river and back in one day.",53
36.0582508,-112.1093486,GCC Park Store at Grand Canyon Visitor Center,Visitor Center,We stopped at the visitor center for the passport stamp on the way out.,54
35.9755323,-112.1247838,Starbucks,Stop,We got coffee and breakfast sandwiches at the Starbucks in Tusayan and then relaxed at the hotel pool for the rest of the day - we were pretty beat after the 9-10 miles in the Grand Canyon.,55
35.9735676,-112.12696,FOODIE CLUB,Lunch,We got some food from Foodie Club for an early dinner/late lunch so we didn't have to go back out for food later. We ended up being too hungry to save it.,56
35.9730417,-112.1259289,Big E Steakhouse & Saloon,Dinner,"We underestimated how hungry we would be so we walked to the steakhouse across the street for a late night ""snack"". We walked by some elk snacking on the landscaping at the hotel.",57
35.2422081,-111.5674413,Conoco Flagstaff Travel Center,Gas,We left the Grand Canyon by heading back towards Flagstaff instead of taking Desert View Drive - I think because I was avoiding tolls on Google Maps and it treats National Park entrances as tolls but we didn't realize this until we noticed Google taking us on an odd route to our hotel outside of Zion National Park. So we got gas just outside of Flagstaff.,58
36.876343,-111.5028016,Horseshoe Bend Overlook Parking Lot,Stop,Page was a planned stop for us to hit Horseshoe Bend and restock at the Walmart there. It was $10 to park and about a half mile walk to the overlook.,59
36.90482170000001,-111.4870229,Walmart Supercenter,Stop,We bought more snacks and sandwich supplies and had sandwiches in the car before continuing towards Zion.,60
36.9357176,-111.4858141,Carl Hayden Visitor Center,Stop,We didn't realize the Glen Canyon Dam was right after Page so we were pleasantly surprised by it and stopped for a couple of pictures at the visitor center (which was closed at the time),61
36.9356903,-111.4862669,Wahweap Overlook,Stop,We also didn't realize we would be getting such a good view of Lake Powell/Wahweap Bay so we stopped by an overlook we found,62
37.0433373,-112.5228797,Conoco,Gas,"Filled up with gas before we got to Zion so we didn't have to worry about gas for our time there or at Bryce, gas was pretty expensive in this area.",63
37.03773839999999,-112.7144334,Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park,Stop,We saw signs for the Coral Pink Sand Dunes and decided to stop there en route to Zion. It was a little more out of the way than we expected and it was $10 to park but it was very cool and I'm glad we stopped there.,64
37.1880563,-112.9987789,Bumbleberry Inn,Hotel,"The hotel we stayed at is in Springdale, which is a little tourist town right outside of Zion but you have to drive through the park to get there on the route we took. This was fine for us since we have an annual pass (which I highly recommend - it pays for itself in about two entrances to a national park)",65
37.1878664,-113.0004892,Sol Foods Supermarket,Dinner,We made salads at the salad bar for dinner and grabbed a couple of little snacks. This place was way more expensive than the store in the Grand Canyon.,66
37.1839547,-113.00234,Switchback Liquor Store,Stop,Walked down to the liquor store down the road to buy a bottle of wine since grocery stores can't sell beverages with more than 5% ABV in Utah.,67
37.1890512,-113.0003147,Oscar's Cafe,Breakfast,The Bumbleberry Inn gave us breakfast vouchers to use at Oscar's Cafe across the street - their restaurant Porter's Smokehouse & Grill burned down. The breakfast we had there was awesome (they didn't charge us for addons).,68
37.199951,-112.9876093,Zion National Park Visitor Center,Stop,There is a free shuttle that takes visitors from stops outside a few hotels in Springdale to the visitor center in the park. We waited about half an hour and decided to walk after being skipped by several full shuttles - we probably would not have gotten on a shuttle if we waited and the walk was only about 15 minutes.,69
37.2690326,-112.9468989,Angels Landing Trail,Trail,"At the visitor center, there is another shuttle that goes to the trailheads and destinations within the park. The line for this was extremely long. They were strict about wearing masks on the shuttles because one of the shuttle drivers passed away due to COVID the previous day. The trail was pretty crowded and we decided not to go all the way to the end of Angel's Landing using the chains, we just had lunch at the top (Lauren calls this the Chicken Coop) and then hiked back down. We were still pretty sore from the Grand Canyon at this point.",70
37.199951,-112.9876093,Zion National Park Visitor Center,Stop,"We planned on going to the Narrows as well, but the weather wasn't looking great and we were told it wasn't recommended to go at the time. So we missed out on that. To be honest, the park was absolutely packed and it took away from the experience so I didn't mind leaving something to come back for. We ended up stopping by Sol Foods again and heading out.",71
37.6735238,-112.1570605,Best Western Plus Ruby's Inn,Hotel,"Not to be confused with the other Best Western Plus or any of the other lodging with ""Ruby's Inn"" in the name. This hotel is really big and has a nice but expensive general store, as well as an indoor pool. It was really busy when we checked in so we had sandwiches for dinner and called it an early night.",72
37.6356547,-112.1491794,Fairyland Loop Trail,Trail,We got to the trailhead around 6 AM and finished the roughly 7 mile loop in about three and a half hours. I highly recommend starting hikes during sunrise - the views changed with the lighting as the sun came up and it took what was already a beautiful hike to the next level. This is definitely one of the highlights of the trip.,73
37.6269874,-112.1720454,Bryce Canyon National Park Visitor Center,Visitor Center,Stopped by the visitor center for Lauren's passport stamp. The sign at the entrance to the park had a line of people waiting to take a picture in front of it.,74
37.6736552,-112.1575529,Ruby's Inn Cowboy's Buffet & Steak Room,Breakfast,"The hotel had a free breakfast buffet that we made it back in time for, so we ate there before packing up and heading to Vegas for the final leg of the trip.",75
37.655771,-113.0837095,Starbucks,Stop,We ordered some coffee for pickup at Starbucks in Cedar City.,76
37.6545876,-113.0882998,Walmart Supercenter,Stop,"We had a planned stop at the Walmart in Cedar City to get a box and some packing tape to carry some of the stuff we picked up on the trip (mostly bottles of wine, which we put in our suitcases and filled the cardboard box with clothes to check at the airport).",77
37.48144500000001,-113.2223005,Shell,Gas,There is a Shell gas station that advertises clean bathrooms outside of Cedar City - I recommend skipping this place because gas is $0.50+ higher than other stations and you can't see the price until you pull up to the pump.,78
37.16212549999999,-113.3897503,Chevron,Gas,We ended up going slightly out of the way for gas and a bathroom break.,79
36.1125269,-115.175947,Bellagio Hotel & Casino,Hotel,"When we were planning the trip, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City were the closest options for airports to drop off the rental car and fly home. We opted for Vegas since neither of us have been there and Lauren got a great deal at the Bellagio. We drove straight there from Cedar City and ran into some heavy desert rain on the way. My favorite part of the drive was going through the mountains in the northwestern corner of Arizona on the Veteran's Memorial Highway (15).",80
36.121174,-115.1696526,CHICA Restaurant,Dinner,"We had dinner at CHICA in The Venetian, which was a little expensive but really good. We walked around the resort a bit, got confused by the indoor Gondola rides, and walked back through the strip to the Bellagio.",81
36.1129455,-115.1765067,Lago,Drinks,"Our room came with a $100 credit so we decided to have some drinks at the resort. The resort was packed and many of the bars were still closed due to COVID, so the restaurant bars were the only options in the resort. The restaurants were also packed, so Lauren and I would just ask hostesses if there were seats at the bar for a drink. We were able to enter some very nice and sought after restaurants without reservations that way.",82
36.1125269,-115.175947,The Mayfair Supper Club - Bellagio,Drinks,We heard live music coming from this bar and decided to stop in. We had a drink while the Golden Knights lost to the Canadiens in overtime.,83
36.1125269,-115.175947,Picasso,Drinks,"We had an interesting conversation with the bartender here about working at the resort throughout COVID - from when things first closed, to the BLM protests on the strip, to limited capacity reopening, and to now. The restaurant has actual Picasso pieces for sale as decorations. We saw the owner of the restaurant, who also owns some other restaurants in the resort.",84
36.1129455,-115.1765067,Baccarat Bar & Lounge,Drinks,"We finished our room credit here because they gave you free snacks (a little plate of popcorn, nuts, and chips). This bar is close to the entrance to the hotel and the casino, and there was live piano while we were there.",85
36.1125269,-115.175947,Sadelle's Cafe,Breakfast,"Our room came with free breakfast at Sadelle's Cafe, which has a nice view of the pool at the Bellagio. We had a nice but quick breakfast there before packing up the room and car.",86
36.1006161,-115.1858822,Texaco,Gas,We left for the airport by going around the strip to get on 593 to go back East through the city towards the airport (which is almost right next to the strip). We topped off the car with gas on the way.,87
36.0838937,-115.1537166,McCarran International Airport,End,We were short on time so I dropped Lauren off at departures and drove to the rental car center to return the car. I took the shuttle back to the airport and we made it to the gate with just enough time to board.,88
