The lot was almost completely empty - they were cleaning cars that had just been turned in and handing them over to people who were in line with reservations as fast as possible. Luckily we only had to wait about 20 minutes for a Nissan compact SUV."

They had a couple of cool wines that were soaked in hops. We shared a quick tasting and had sandwiches in the car before heading out.

Terlingua,2021-06-16,FALSE,Drinks,$26.50,Starlight Theatre Restaurant,"631 Ivey Rd, Terlingua, TX 79852",Starlight Theatre,We walked down to the Starlight Theatre for a drink while we waited for the sun to set so we could go stargazing. It was pretty quiet but has a nice stage and I imagine it's awesome when there is live music. Someone told us they have festivals in the area and it gets packed then but it was nice and quiet while we were there.

Marfa,2021-06-17,TRUE,Trail,,Santa Elena Canyon Trail,,Santa Elena Canyon,"When we got back from the Window View, we took the Ross Maxwell Scenic drive to Santa Elena Canyon and hiked part of the trail there. You can walk into the river (and into Mexico) but the trail is on the US side and it goes pretty far into the canyon. We hiked part of it and ate sandwiches for lunch at the highest point. It was 100+ degrees so we didn't spend too much time in the heat. You have to take the scenic drive back out of the park so we stopped at a couple of the outlooks on the way out."

I love the Arizona/New Mexico style of jerky that is thin and dry, but they also had more of a tender, thicker style for Lauren. We were surprised by all of the nut farms you see along the highway - they just appear as random rows of trees in the middle of the desert."
Tucson,2021-06-18,FALSE,Stop,,Willcox Commercial Co,"180 Railroad Ave, Willcox, AZ 85643",Wilcox Commercial Building Tasting Rooms,"Just as we were surprised by Texas wine country, we were also surprised by Arizona wine country and we made a stop in Wilcox.

Sedona,2021-06-19,TRUE,Trail,,Hugh Norris Trailhead,,Hugh Norris Trailhead,"We hiked part of the Hugh Norris Trail in Saguaro National Park, which was one of my favorite hikes in the whole trip. Lauren was worried about rattlesnakes and mountain lions, but thankfully we didn't run into any. It got to 100+ degrees by 10 AM - I would have liked to do more of the trail but it we weren't really prepared for a long hike at the hottest time of day."
Sedona,2021-06-19,TRUE,Visitor Center,,Red Hills Visitor Center,"2700 N Kinney Rd, Tucson, AZ 85743",Red Hills Visitor Center,We went to the visitor center to get Lauren's national park passport stamp and some cactus merch.

Grand Canyon,2021-06-20,FALSE,Stop,,CVS,"20 Airport Rd, Sedona, AZ 86336",CVS,We stopped at the CVS near Mariposa to get some supplies - I hurt my knee during the scramble part of the Cathedral Rock hike so we got a brace there.

Grand Canyon,2021-06-20,TRUE,Stop,,Grand Canyon IMAX Theater,"450 AZ-64, Grand Canyon Village, AZ 86023",Grand Canyon IMAX Theater,We were recommended the documentary they show about the Grand Canyon at the IMAX theater down the road in Tusayan for $10 - it's an interesting 30-45 min documentary but I'd only recommend it if you have some extra time to kill. It talks a little bit about the history of the canyon in a narrative style.
Grand Canyon,2021-06-20,FALSE,Stop,,Tusayan General Store,"577 AZ-64, Grand Canyon Village, AZ 86023",Tusayan General Store,"The general store in town actually had surprisingly good prices on lots of items, I was expecting high prices being so close to the park. We didn't really need much since we stopped at Target in Flagstaff."
Grand Canyon,2021-06-20,FALSE,Stop,,Lipan Point,,Lipan Point,"We drove through Desert View Drive, stopping at almost every viewpoint along the way to Lipan Point - the Tusayan Ruins and watchtower were closed when we were there so we couldn't stop there. We had sandwiches for dinner at Lipan Point"
Grand Canyon,2021-06-21,TRUE,Trail,,Bright Angel Trailhead,"15 Bright Angel Trail, Grand Canyon Village, AZ 86023",Bright Angel Trail,"We were at the trailhead by 5:15 AM to hike Bright Angel and we were planning to make it to Indian Garden before turning around - we ended up making it there and back in about 7 hours with breaks. We parked in Lot D by the Backcountry Information Office and there was plenty of parking space when we got there in the morning, but it was pretty full by the time we got back. We were surprised by how many people were attempting the hike so late in the morning - we had already seen one person airlifted from one of the outposts for dehydration and heat exhaustion. This was my favorite hike of the trip by far - not too tough from a hiking perspective but long and hot. There is a reason for all the signs that tell you not to hike to the river and back in one day."
Grand Canyon,2021-06-21,TRUE,Visitor Center,,GCC Park Store at Grand Canyon Visitor Center,"6 S Entrance Rd, Grand Canyon Village, AZ 86023",Grand Canyon Visitor Center,We stopped at the visitor center for the passport stamp on the way out.

We walked by some elk snacking on the landscaping at the hotel."
Zion National Park,2021-06-22,FALSE,Gas,$26.31,Conoco Flagstaff Travel Center,"7180 US-89, Flagstaff, AZ 86004",Conoco,We left the Grand Canyon by heading back towards Flagstaff instead of taking Desert View Drive - I think because I was avoiding tolls on Google Maps and it treats National Park entrances as tolls but we didn't realize this until we noticed Google taking us on an odd route to our hotel outside of Zion National Park. So we got gas just outside of Flagstaff.
Zion National Park,2021-06-22,TRUE,Stop,$10.00,Horseshoe Bend Overlook Parking Lot,,Horseshoe Bend,Page was a planned stop for us to hit Horseshoe Bend and restock at the Walmart there. It was $10 to park and about a half mile walk to the overlook.

This was fine for us since we have an annual pass (which I highly recommend - it pays for itself in about two entrances to a national park)"
Zion National Park,2021-06-22,TRUE,Dinner,$77.43,Sol Foods Supermarket,"995 Zion – Mount Carmel Hwy, Springdale, UT 84767",Sol Foods Supermarket,We made salads at the salad bar for dinner and grabbed a couple of little snacks. This place was way more expensive than the store in the Grand Canyon.
Zion National Park,2021-06-22,FALSE,Stop,,Switchback Liquor Store,"1149 Zion Park Blvd, Springdale, UT 84767",Switchback Liquor Store,Walked down to the liquor store down the road to buy a bottle of wine since grocery stores can't sell beverages with more than 5% ABV in Utah.

The breakfast we had there was awesome (they didn't charge us for addons).
Bryce Canyon National Park,2021-06-23,TRUE,Stop,,Zion National Park Visitor Center,"Zion National Park, 1 Zion Park Blvd, Springdale, UT 84767",Zion National Park Visitor Center,There is a free shuttle that takes visitors from stops outside a few hotels in Springdale to the visitor center in the park. We waited about half an hour and decided to walk after being skipped by several full shuttles - we probably would not have gotten on a shuttle if we waited and the walk was only about 15 minutes.
Bryce Canyon National Park,2021-06-23,TRUE,Trail,,Angels Landing Trail,"Angels Landing Trail, Hurricane, UT 84737",Angel's Landing,"At the visitor center, there is another shuttle that goes to the trailheads and destinations within the park. The line for this was extremely long. They were strict about wearing masks on the shuttles because one of the shuttle drivers passed away due to COVID the previous day. The trail was pretty crowded and we decided not to go all the way to the end of Angel's Landing using the chains, we just had lunch at the top (Lauren calls this the Chicken Coop) and then hiked back down. We were still pretty sore from the Grand Canyon at this point."
Bryce Canyon National Park,2021-06-23,TRUE,Stop,,Zion National Park Visitor Center,"Zion National Park, 1 Zion Park Blvd, Springdale, UT 84767",Zion National Park Visitor Center,"We planned on going to the Narrows as well, but the weather wasn't looking great and we were told it wasn't recommended to go at the time. So we missed out on that. To be honest, the park was absolutely packed and it took away from the experience so I didn't mind leaving something to come back for. We ended up stopping by Sol Foods again and heading out."
Bryce Canyon National Park,2021-06-23,TRUE,Hotel,,Best Western Plus Ruby's Inn,"26 South Main St, Bryce Canyon City, UT 84764",Best Western Plus Ruby's Inn,"Not to be confused with the other Best Western Plus or any of the other lodging with ""Ruby's Inn"" in the name. This hotel is really big and has a nice but expensive general store, as well as an indoor pool. It was really busy when we checked in so we had sandwiches for dinner and called it an early night."
Las Vegas,2021-06-24,TRUE,Trail,,Fairyland Loop Trail,"Fairyland Loop Trail, Bryce, UT 84764",Fairyland Loop,We got to the trailhead around 6 AM and finished the roughly 7 mile loop in about three and a half hours. I highly recommend starting hikes during sunrise - the views changed with the lighting as the sun came up and it took what was already a beautiful hike to the next level. This is definitely one of the highlights of the trip.
Las Vegas,2021-06-24,TRUE,Visitor Center,,Bryce Canyon National Park Visitor Center,"UT-63, Bryce Canyon City, UT 84764",Bryce Canyon National Park Visitor Center,Stopped by the visitor center for Lauren's passport stamp.

Las Vegas,2021-06-24,FALSE,Gas,,Shell,"3802 UT-144, New Harmony, UT 84757",Shell,There is a Shell gas station that advertises clean bathrooms outside of Cedar City - I recommend skipping this place because gas is $0.50+ higher than other stations and you can't see the price until you pull up to the pump.
Las Vegas,2021-06-24,FALSE,Gas,$32.95,Chevron,"4390 W State St, Hurricane, UT 84737",Chevron,We ended up going slightly out of the way for gas and a bathroom break.

We opted for Vegas since neither of us have been there and Lauren got a great deal at the Bellagio. We drove straight there from Cedar City and ran into some heavy desert rain on the way. My favorite part of the drive was going through the mountains in the northwestern corner of Arizona on the Veteran's Memorial Highway (15). "

The resort was packed and many of the bars were still closed due to COVID, so the restaurant bars were the only options in the resort.
